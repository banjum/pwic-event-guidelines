# Best Practices to follow for PWiC Medium Post about PWiC Events
Here are the best practices to follow while preparing and publishing a medium blog post:

## Overall Flow
- Try to keep the blog post to no more than 5 minutes of read
- Follow the program flow while capturing details, split into sections and add heading with each section
- Add a section "Partners and Sponsors" if the event was supported by a third party 
- Add a section "Useful References" if there are any informative links that we would like to share with reference to the event and its program  
- Add a section "About the Author(s)" and add bried intro about the author. This should be the last section 

## Formatting
- If an individual is mentioned, add a link to their LinkedIn Profile (add a hyperlink to their name)
- If an organization is mentioned, add hyperlinks to that organization
- Headings -  Use T headings instead of bold for section headings
- Add links to resources and reference materials.  For example github repo links to PWiC github resources would be great

## Photos
- Add one group photo to the top, it is used as thumbnail to the blog
- Add photos with each section that are relevant to capturing the activity

## Credit photographer
    - Example: Photo credits: Snapshot Photography
    - add a link to the photographer's site

## Credit Marketing team: example: 
    - Design credits: weprint
    - Add a link to the design team's website - <Need link>

## Peer Review
Ask one or more member(s) of the Medium publishing team for your local PWiC chapter to proofread your post while it is still in draft mode
